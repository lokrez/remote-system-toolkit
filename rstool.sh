# Remote System Toolkit Command-Line Tool (rstool)

# This is a conceptual prototype of a command-line utility that would mirror
# the functionality of the web interface. It would provide advanced users with
# a non-interactive, scriptable way to perform system recovery and management
# tasks.
#
# THIS IS A PROTOTYPE AND DOES NOT PERFORM ANY REAL ACTIONS.
